# Chicago_Senior_Shared_Housing_Project
An exploration on Chicago South housing supply and senior shared housing needs

**I.	Executive Summary**

Our project provides elderly South Siders with roommates in safe neighborhoods. After careful analysis, our work suggests (1) relocation to a safe neighborhood per the AARP Livability Index and (2) finding a roommate both save money; and that age, income, and health are key factors impacting housing needs for the elderly. We also share professionals’ recommendations.

We recommend accessible senior-focused housing communities or a matching platform for elderly individuals to meet. We conclude with suggestions for further research: (1) identification of stakeholders and funding sources, (2) a limited-scale shared housing initiative pilot, (3) establishing legal frameworks for roommate matching, (4) expansion of geographic scope, and (5) conducting a longitudinal study on the effect(s) of shared housing. See appendices for further detail.


**II.	Background and Motivation**

Evidence shows the national elderly homeless population would triple between 2020 and 2030.  (Santos 2020) Between 1990 and 2010, divorce rates among Americans over the age of fifty doubled. Elders who live alone are generally lonelier than those who do not.  (Shoichet 2023) Older Americans struggle to downsize: today, only 7 percent of new homes are 1,400 square feet or less. Historically Black neighborhoods, such as those on Chicago’s South Side, see the largest numbers of seniors unable to downsize.

Housing construction for elderly Chicagoans since the ruling Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority has focused on building affordable housing in majority-white neighborhoods. (Choldin 2019) In this ruling, the plaintiffs alleged that the Chicago Housing Authority contributed to segregation by only building public housing in segregated Black communities. Historically, Chicago real estate companies engaged in redlining, in which those from Black neighborhoods “were usually denied bank loans and insurance, limiting their housing prospects and mobility.” (Serrato et al. 2022) Chicago remains segregated, and 80.45% of those at least 65 years old on the South Side are Black. (Review of Population 60 Years and Older in the United States n.d.)

We aim to reduce living costs and combat social isolation among Chicago’s older adults. To avoid engaging in systemic bigotry, we include accommodations based off of the roommates’ identity and incorporate a targeting system to locate marginalized minorities who would most benefit from our project’s priorities.

**III.	Data Sources and Methodology** 

The AARP Livability Index evaluates general community livability for residents regardless of age across seven categories: Housing, Neighborhood, Transportation, Environment, Health, Engagement, and Opportunity, assigning scores from 0 to 100. Metrics include housing availability and costs, healthcare access, transit options, pollution levels, broadband access, and income inequality. A community's livability score averages these categories, offering a comprehensive measure of neighborhood quality.
